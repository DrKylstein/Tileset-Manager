		<h1>Tileset Manager Help</h1>
		<h2>What's a Tilehead?</h2>
		<p>
			Every mod using the V2 patch needs one file named TILEHEAD.CK1 or TILEHEAD.CK2 or TILEHEAD.CK3.
			This file specifies which tileset to use for each level in the game.
		</p>
		<h2>The editor view</h2>
		<p>
			The editor lists each level and the tileset file assigned to it.
			To change the tileset addignment, double click on the tileset name next to the level.
			This will open a file dialog, in which you can choose the tileset file to use.
			Note that the file must be in the same directory with the TILEHEAD file and the other mod files,
			but the editor does not enforce this.
		</p>
		<h2>The 32 level patch</h2>
		<p>
			Below the level list, there is a checkbox labeled "Using 32-level patch".
			As the name suggests, you will want to check it when using the extra levels patch.
			This box decides whether 16 or 32 levels are shown in the editor (not including special level files).
			It doesn't change the contents of the TILEHEAD file, but is provided as a convenience.
